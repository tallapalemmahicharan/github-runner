## Suggested Validation

These checks are suggestions based on the detected files and technologies. Adjust paths and options to the actual project, and review commands before running them.

- Review the Terraform configuration and required provider versions.
- Run `terraform fmt -check` from the relevant module directory.
- Run `terraform init -backend=false` followed by `terraform validate` where the module supports it.
- Review workflow triggers, job dependencies, permissions, secrets, and referenced actions.

## Security Notes

- Never commit passwords, access keys, tokens, private keys, or real environment files.
- Review configuration files for account IDs, resource names, and environment-specific values before sharing or deploying.
- For infrastructure and deployment projects, review potential costs and permissions before applying changes.
- Treat scripts that delete, modify, or provision resources with care.
